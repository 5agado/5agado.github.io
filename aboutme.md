*"50% Data-Science and 50% Graphics."*

I'm a data-scientist at Zalando Dublin, working on putting machine-learning solutions in production. My main expertise is on deep-learning, computer-vision and generative-models. [Python is love]

I also produce plenty of graphics by combining deep generative-models, procedural 3D art (Blender <3) and traditional drawing.

I have a passion for artificial-intelligence and ALife that goes far beyond the sole working environment. Additional interests include lucid-dreaming, quantified-self, transhumanism, skiing, body-building, fitness and nutrition.
