*"49% Data-Science and 49% Graphics."*

I'm a senior data-scientist at Zalando Dublin, working on delivering machine-learning solutions to production. My main expertise is in deep-learning, representation-learning, computer-vision, generative-models and synthetic-data-generation. [Python is love]

I also experiment plenty with graphics by combining generative-models, procedural computer-graphics (Blender <3) and traditional drawing.

Additional interests include ALife, computational-creativity, lucid-dreaming, quantified-self, transhumanism, skiing, body-building, fitness and nutrition.
