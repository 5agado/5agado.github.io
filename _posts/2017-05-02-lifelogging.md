title: On The Future of Life Logging — A Speculative View
---

This is a light and speculative entry where I brainstorm personal ideas about the future of lifelogging. I will focus mainly on the practical aspects of such activity, while largely ignoring ethical, moral and psychological issues. Even if speculative, I tried to include as many “good” references as possible, and I as well hope that ideas here expressed can themselves inspire you or simply give you food for thought.
