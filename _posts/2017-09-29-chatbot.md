In this post, I am going instead to illustrate a deep-learning-based solution for the construction of a chatbot off-topic behavior and “personality”. In other words, when confronted with off-topic questions, the bot will try to automatically generate a possibly relevant answer from scratch, based only on a pre-trained RNN model.
