title: Conversation Analyzer - An Introduction

The content of this article is mostly based on my conversation-analyzer python project. There you can find specific info about the implementation, how to set it up and actually run it on your conversations (the code can be used for any kind of conversation once the text content is properly parsed). On the other hand, what I will discuss here is a generic overview of various aspects and methods related to the task of conversation analysis.
