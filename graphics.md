As a hobby I often fiddle around different kinds of visual graphics: traditional drawing, digital painting, procedural and generative graphics.

[I publish my "polished" works on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/amartinelli1/) and document [experiments and process on Twitter](https://twitter.com/5agado) and [Threads](https://www.threads.net/@amartinelli1).

Tools of the trade: Phothoshop, Blender and my loyal Wacom Intuos Pro.
