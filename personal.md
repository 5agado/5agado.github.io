[One can tell a lot about a person based on what he/she reads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/59270908-alex-martinelli).

My fascination with AI and ALife, and interest in data-science got me
inevitably involved in movements like quantified-self and transhumanism, as well as interested brain-computer interfaces and mind-uploading. Closely related to the quantified-self spirit, I am also very concerned about **personal optimization**, which I loosely define as “improvement of personal efficiency, by means of analysis and tweaking of behaviors, habits and routines”.
For such task, I want to suggest [TiddlyWiki](http://tiddlywiki.com) as a personal wiki. For time management I tend to follow the Pomodoro technique, and a combination of [Toggl](https://toggl.com/) and [Wunderlist](https://www.wunderlist.com/) (now Microsoft TODO) as TODOs and habits trackers.
